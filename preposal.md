# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I am thinking of either coding casino roulette, or a variation of poker. I'm leaning towards roulette because I think that would be more under my capabilities. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I plan to work on this myself.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

As of now, no, however as I carry out this project I'm sure the questions will roll in.
